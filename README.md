## Overview of the Analysis
V. Isualize would like to see the ride-sharing data by the different city types of Rural, Suburban, and Urban by weekly fares. A multiple-line graph will be used to show a visual of the results.

### Results 
Rural, Suburban, and Urban city types have the following differences:
- Total Rides are low for Rural, medium for Suburban, and high for Urban which was expected based on population density.
- Total Drivers reflected similar results as total rides. Rural and Suburban had more riders than drivers but Urban on the other hand had significantly more drivers that rides which is concerning. This will significantly lower driver income.
- Total Fares was as expected with the most fares for Urban, middle for Suburban, and least for Rural.
- Average Fare per Rider had the highest for Rural, medium for Suburban, and lowest for Urban. This was expected as Rural should travel the longest distance and Suburban travel less than Urban. 
- Average Fare per Driver shows the highest fare for Rural, medium for Suburban, and lowest for Urban. This matches the total drivers to total rides ratio showing there are too many drivers for Urban areas.

### Summary
I would reccommend the following:
1. Lower the amount of Urban drivers. There are currently more drivers than riders which will make it hard to retain drivers in the long term.
2. Increase prices or add surge pricing to Suburban and Urban areas. Suburban and Urban living should have more traffic and demand so rides and drivers should see higher fares. 
3. Add cheaper pricing or coupons for times of low demand to increase rides during lower ride weeks.
