### Election-Audit Summary: 
This script can be reused for any election with minor changes to the code. Due to how this script is coded it can scale to account for any number of counties, candidates, or votes. If provided the data, this script can be edited to analyze other information such as voter demographics or voter turnout. In addition, the script can also be edited to output multiple text files where one can be released to the public and a private text file with more detailed breakdowns of the voters can be kept private.
